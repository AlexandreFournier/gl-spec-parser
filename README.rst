OpenGL_ Specifications Parser
=============================

This project is a one file Python_ script that parses:

- `Khronos OpenGL 2.1 References Pages`_ (docbook)
- `Khronos OpenGL 3.3 References Pages`_ (docbook)
- `Khronos OpenGL 4.1 References Pages`_ (docbook)
- `Khronos OpenGL Extensions`_ (not-well-formated text format)
- `Khronos OpenGL Enumerants`_ (ugly-formated text format)

It's aim is mainly to build :

- Everything to generate bindinds in one XML file
- More complicated D bindings for GL/GLU/GLX/GLEXT in one module


F.A.Q.
------

**Why XML instead of SWIG_ or any other IDL ?**

XML is easy to parse and most languages provide libxml_ bindings or XML parsers. This way it is very easy to generate bindings for other languages.

**Why Khronos does not provide easy-to-parse specifications ?**

Just read this quote_ from the OpenGL_'s discussion board:

        The specs contain much more information than what is (or *can* be) used in the C headers. Some of it is said to be used as part of the build process for various drivers. Other parts can be used to create strongly-typed enumerations (unfortunately, functions defined after OpenGL 1.4 use generic GLenum types instead of exact enums - in OpenTK, we've fixed this by hand for every single function up to 3.2). Finally, there's stuff like glx protocol information, display-list compatibility that is simply not exposed in the C headers.

        The main issue is that the .spec files change over time. New directives are being added, old ones fall in disuse or start being used inconsistently... Fortunately, things have gotten better after the 3.0 release - several long-standing bugs have been fixed and the editors seem to have gotten much more aggressive. I think the new deprecation directives have played a large part in this.

        FYI, there is no problem defining the "perfect spec format" to capture all .spec information (porting everything to XML is less than a day's worth of work). The issue is that drivers have come to rely on the .spec files to build and the IHVs (rightly or not) resist any change to their build process. (No, I'm not making this up - you can search these forums for the exact quote if you wish. It was made by Jon Leech around the 3.0 release, if I remember correctly.)

        The irony on the matter is this quote on the registry, added around 2007: **"Yes, these databases should be moved to a modern XML-based format. Patience." :P**
