Overview

    This extension allows creating an OpenGL ES 2.0 context.

New Procedures and Functions

    None

New Tokens

    Accepted as a bit in the attribute value for
    WGL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK_ARB in <*attribList>:

	WGL_CONTEXT_ES2_PROFILE_BIT_EXT		0x00000004

Additions to the OpenGL / GLX / GLX Protocol Specificaitons

    None. This specification is written for WGL.

Additions to the WGL specification

    This extension modifies language specified in the
    WGL_ARB_create_context and WGL_ARB_create_context_profile
    extensions.

    In the description of wglCreateContextAttribsARB, replace the
    sentence

   "... If a version less than or equal to 3.0 is requested, the context
    returned may implement any of the following versions:"

    with

   "... If the version requested is 2.0, and the
    WGL_CONTEXT_ES2_PROFILE_BIT_EXT bit is set in the
    WGL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK_ARB attribute (see below), then the context
    returned will implement OpenGL ES 2.0. This is the only way in which
    an implementation may request an OpenGL ES 2.0 context.

    Otherwise, if a version less than or equal to 3.0 is requested, the
    context returned may implement any of the following versions:"


    Replace the sentence

   "... If the requested OpenGL version is less than 3.2,
    WGL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK_ARB is ignored and the functionality of the
    context is determined solely by the requested version."

    with

   "... If the WGL_CONTEXT_ES2_PROFILE_BIT_EXT bit is set, and the
    requested version is 2.0, then a context implementing OpenGL ES 2.0
    is returned; otherwise, if the requested OpenGL version is less than
    3.2, WGL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK_ARB is ignored and the functionality
    of the context is determined solely by the requested version."

    Add prior to the sentence

   "The attribute name WGL_CONTEXT_FLAGS_ARB specifies a set of flag
    bits affecting the rendering context.":

   "If the OpenGL ES 2.0 profile is requested, then the context returned
    cannot implement additional functionality, including functionality
    defined only by the core or compatibility profiles, unless such
    functionality is defined by extensions that are themselves specified
    relative to OpenGL ES 2.0[*].
	[*] Such functionality should have a corresponding extension
	specification in the OpenGL ES Registry. In some
	implementations, vendor extensions defined relative to OpenGL ES
	2.0, but not yet added to the OpenGL ES Registry, may also be
	supported."

    Replace the bullet point starting "* If attribute
    WGL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK_ARB has no bits set;..." with

 "* If attribute WGL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK_ARB has no bits set; has any
    bits set other than WGL_CONTEXT_CORE_PROFILE_BIT_ARB,
    WGL_CONTEXT_COMPATIBILITY_PROFILE_BIT_ARB, or
    WGL_CONTEXT_ES2_PROFILE_BIT_EXT; has more than one of these bits
    set; or if the implementation does not supported the requested
    profile, then ERROR_INVALID_PROFILE_ARB is generated."

Dependencies on WGL_ARB_extensions_string

    Because there is no way to extend WGL, these calls are defined in
    the ICD and can be called by obtaining the address with
    wglGetProcAddress. Because this extension is a WGL extension, it is
    not included in the GL_EXTENSIONS string. Its existence can be
    determined with the WGL_ARB_extensions_string extension.

Errors

    ERROR_INVALID_PROFILE_ARB is generated if the value of
    WGL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK_ARB contains more than a single valid
    profile bit.

Issues

 1) How is an OpenGL ES 2.0 "profile" defined in a desktop OpenGL
    implementation?

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is essentially a stripped-down version of OpenGL 2.0
    with a few added features, so it is natural to consider it a profile
    of OpenGL 2.0. This is potentially confusing, in that the API
    profile mechanism was not introduced until OpenGL 3.2. However, the
    extended context creation mechanism operates outside the scope of a
    GL context, and we can define the meaning of "version 2.0, profile
    ES2" to be an OpenGL ES 2.0 context.

 2) May an OpenGL ES 2.0 "profile" include OpenGL functionality
    introduced by OpenGL 2.1 and later versions?

    PROPOSED: NO, except in the form of extensions that are themselves
    defined relative to OpenGL ES 2.0. This restriction is intended to
    make it difficult to create ill-defined conglomerations of OpenGL ES
    and OpenGL features and to eliminate subjective interpretations of
    what it means to subset a GL extension for implementation against
    OpenGL ES.

    If features specific to OpenGL ES 2.0 are required together with
    features from recent versions of OpenGL, a different mechanism, such
    as an OpenGL extension defining those OpenGL ES 2.0 features, may be
    appropriate.

 3) Is implementation of an OpenGL ES 2.0 profile mandatory for a
    desktop OpenGL implementation?

    RESOLVED: NO. The ARB considered making support for an ES 2.0
    profile mandatory for an OpenGL 4.1 implementation, but decided
    against it. Most ARB members would prefer that people use EGL to
    access OpenGL ES 2.0, whether on the desktop or on mobile devices.

 4) Do we need a GL_CONTEXT_ES2_PROFILE_BIT_EXT token?

    RESOLVED: NO. The GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK query only exists in
    desktop GL, while creating an ES2 "profile" results in an OpenGL ES
    2.0 context, which does not have the query. Therefore at present,
    it's not possible to ever return this bit from the query and it is
    not needed.

    If, in the future, ES and GL are unified under the profile mechanism
    such that there is an actual "embedded" profile of GL, then this
    resolution may need to change.
