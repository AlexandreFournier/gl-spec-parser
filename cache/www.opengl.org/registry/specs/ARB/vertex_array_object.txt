    ARB Extension #54

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL 2.1 specification (December
    1st, 2006).

    APPLE_vertex_array_object affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This extension introduces named vertex array objects which encapsulate
    vertex array state on the client side.  These objects allow applications
    to rapidly switch between large sets of array state.  In addition, layered
    libraries can return to the default array state by simply creating and
    binding a new vertex array object.

    This extension differs from GL_APPLE_vertex_array_object in that client
    memory cannot be accessed through a non-zero vertex array object.  It also
    differs in that vertex array objects are explicitly not sharable between
    contexts.

New Procedures and Functions

    void BindVertexArray(uint array);

    void DeleteVertexArrays(sizei n, const uint *arrays);

    void GenVertexArrays(sizei n, uint *arrays);

    boolean IsVertexArray(uint array);

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <pname> parameter of GetBooleanv, GetIntegerv,
    GetFloatv, and GetDoublev:

        VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING                       0x85B5

Additions to Chapter 2 of the OpenGL 2.1 Specification (OpenGL Operation)

    Add new section "2.X Vertex Array Objects" between sections "2.9 Buffer
    Objects" and "2.10 Rectangles".

    The buffer objects that are to be used by the vertex and geometry stages
    of the GL are collected together to form a vertex array object.  All
    state related to the definition of data used by the vertex processor is
    encapsulated in a vertex array object.

    The command

        void GenVertexArrays(sizei n, uint *arrays);

    returns <n> previous unused vertex array object names in <arrays>.  These
    names are marked as used, for the purposes of GenVertexArrays only,
    and are initialized with the state listed in tables 6.6 (except for
    the CLIENT_ACTIVE_TEXTURE selector state), 6.7 and 6.8.

    Vertex array objects are deleted by calling

        void DeleteVertexArrays(sizei n, const uint *arrays);

    <arrays> contains <n> names of vertex array objects to be deleted.  Once a
    vertex array object is deleted it has no contents and its name becomes unused.
    If a vertex array object that is currently bound is deleted, the binding
    for that object reverts to zero and the default vertex array becomes
    current.  Unused names in <arrays> are silently ignored, as is the value
    zero.

    A vertex array object can be made part of the current rendering state with
    the command

        void BindVertexArray(uint array);

    <array> is the vertex array object name. The resulting vertex array
    object is a new state vector, comprising all the state values listed
    in tables 6.6 (except for the CLIENT_ACTIVE_TEXTURE selector state),
    6.7, and 6.8. BindVertexArray may also be used to bind an existing
    vertex array object. If the bind is successful no change is made to
    the state of the bound vertex array object, and any previous binding
    is broken.

    The currently bound vertex array object is used for all commands
    which modify vertex array state, such as VertexAttribPointer and
    EnableVertexAttribArray; all commands which draw from vertex arrays,
    such as DrawArrays and DrawElements; and all queries of vertex
    array state (see chapter 6).

    BindVertexArray fails and an INVALID_OPERATION error is generated if
    array is not a name returned from a previous call to
    GenVertexArrays, or if such a name has since been deleted with
    DeleteVertexArrays. An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated
    if VertexAttribPointer or VertexAttribIPointer is called while a
    non-zero vertex array object is bound and zero is bound to the
    ARRAY_BUFFER buffer object binding point[fn].
	[fn: This error makes it impossible to create a vertex array
              object containing client array pointers.]

Additions to Chapter 3 of the OpenGL 2.1 Specification (Rasterization)

    None

Additions to Chapter 4 of the OpenGL 2.1 Specification (Per-Fragment
    Operations and the Framebuffer)

    None

Additions to Chapter 5 of the OpenGL 2.1 Specification (Special Functions)

    Modify Section 5.4, Display Lists (p. 240)

    (add new paragraph after 10th paragraph on p. 244)

    Vertex array objects: GenVertexArrays, DeleteVertexArrays,
    BindVertexArray

Additions to Chapter 6 of the OpenGL 2.1 Specification (Querying GL State)

    Modify Section 6.1.2, Data Conversions (p. 248)

    (add new paragraph after last paragraph of section, p. 249)

    Vertex-array state variables are qualified by the value of
    VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING to determine which vertex array object is queried.
    Tables 6.6, 6.7, and 6.8 define the set of state stored in a vertex array
    object.

    Modify Section 6.1.11, Pointer and String Queries (p. 257)

    (add new paragraph after 1st paragraph of section, p. 257)

    Queries for VERTEX_ARRAY_POINTER, NORMAL_ARRAY_POINTER,
    COLOR_ARRAY_POINTER, SECONDARY_COLOR_ARRAY_POINTER, INDEX_ARRAY_POINTER,
    TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY_POINTER, FOG_COORD_ARRAY_POINTER, or
    EDGE_FLAG_ARRAY_POINTER return the value stored in the currently bound
    vertex array object.

    Add new section "6.1.X Vertex Array Object Queries" between sections
    "6.1.13 Buffer Object Queries" and "6.1.14 Shader and Program Queries".

    The command

        boolean IsVertexArray(uint array);

    returns TRUE if <array> is the name of a vertex array object previously
    returned by GenVertexArrays. If <array> is zero, or a non-zero value
    that is not the name of a vertex array object, IsVertexArray returns
    FALSE. No error is generated is <array> is not a valid vertex array
    object name.

    Modify Section 6.1.14, Shader and Program Queries, p. 260

    (modify the first paragraph on page 263)

    Replace the text

    "Note that all the queries except CURRENT_VERTEX_ATTRIB return client
    state."

    with

    "Note that all the queries except CURRENT_VERTEX_ATTRIB return values
    stored in the currently bound vertex array object (the value of
    VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING).  If the zero object is bound, these values
    are client state."

    (modify the 3rd paragraph on page 263 to read)

    The command

        void GetVertexAttribPointerv(uint index, enum pname, void **pointer);

    obtains the pointer named <pname> for vertex attribute numbered <index>
    and places the information in <pointer>.  <pname> must be
    VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_POINTER.  The value returned is queried from the
    currently bound vertex array object.  If the zero object is bound, the
    value is queried from client state.  An INVALID_VALUE error is generated
    if <index> is greater than or equal to the value of MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS.

Additions to Appendix X of the OpenGL X.X specification (Sharing)

    Vertex array objects are not sharable between contexts.

Additions to the GLX Specification

    No change is made to the GLX API.

Interactions with APPLE_vertex_array_object

    Vertex array objects as defined by this spec fill the same role as the
    objects defined in APPLE_vertex_array_object but have some significant
    semantic differences.  If both types of object are supported by an
    implementation, BindVertexArray will accept object names from either
    type of object.  Names passed to BindVertexArray must have been
    previously returned by GenVertexArrays, previously returned by
    GenVertexArraysAPPLE, or previously bound by BindVertexArrayAPPLE.
    BindVertexArrayAPPLE must also accept names that were previously returned 
    by GenVertexArrays and bound with BindVertexArray.

    In addition, the enumerant value for VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING is the same
    as VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_APPLE.

    This allows applications using ARB VAOs to safely call into libraries that
    internally use Apple VAOs, and vice-versa.

    The first bind call, either BindVertexArray or BindVertexArrayAPPLE,
    determines the semantic of the object.

Issues

    (1) Are vertex array objects client or server state?

    DISCUSSION: Ideally they should be server state, like texture objects.
    However, much of the state that is encapsulated by VAOs is client-state.

    RESOLUTION: Resolved.  VAOs are server state.  This essentially means that
    client array state must be duplicated on the server.  For practical
    purposes, VBOs already require this duplication.

    (2) What happens when a buffer object that is attached to a non-current
        VAO is deleted?

    RESOLUTION: Nothing (though a reference count may be decremented). 
    A buffer object that is deleted while attached to a non-current VAO
    is treated just like a buffer object bound to another context (or to
    a current VAO in another context).

    (3) Are VAOs sharable?

    DISCUSSION: There are many difficulties and complications involved in
    guaranteeing correct behavior when "container" objects are sharable.

    RESOLUTION: RESOLVED: NO.

    (4) Can buffer objects attached to a VAO be modified?

    DISCUSSION: Operations such as updating the contents of a buffer object,
    either via mapping the buffer or calling BufferSubData, are not
    problematic.  However, operations that cause a change in the underlying
    data structure can be very problematic from a hardware / driver
    perspective.  Currently the only such operation is BufferData which causes
    the buffer to be reallocated.

    RESOLUTION: RESOLVED.  Yes.  Calling BufferData on a buffer attached
    to a VAO is allowed.

    (5) What are the interactions with this extension and
        APPLE_vertex_array_object?

    DISCUSSION:  The only question is what the behavior should be when both an
    ARB vertex array object and an Apple vertex array object are bound at the
    same time.

    RESOLUTION: Resolved.  If both extensions are supported by an 
    implementation, both object types share a name space.  Most of the useful
    interactions fall out as a result of that.  Please refer to the section
    "Interactions with APPLE_vertex_array_object" above for more details.

    (6) Why don't the new tokens and entry points in this extension have
       "ARB" suffixes like other ARB extensions?

    RESOLVED: Unlike most ARB extensions, this is a strict subset of
    functionality already approved in OpenGL 3.0. This extension exists
    only to support that functionality on older hardware that cannot
    implement a full OpenGL 3.0 driver. Since there are no possible
    behavior changes between the ARB extension and core features, source
    code compatibility is improved by not using suffixes on the
    extension.
